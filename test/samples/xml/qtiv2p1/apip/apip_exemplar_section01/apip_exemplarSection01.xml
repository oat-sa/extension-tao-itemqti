            <strong id="content11">An Unbelievable Night</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="authorLine" id="content20">by Franz Hohler</p>
        <p id="content6">Anina was ten years old, so even half asleep she could find her way from
            her room to the bathroom. The door to her room was usually open a crack, and the
            nightlight in the hallway made it light enough to get to the bathroom past the telephone
            stand.</p>
        <p id="content17">One night, as she passed the telephone stand on her way to the bathroom,
            Anina heard something that sounded like a quiet hissing. But, because she was half
            asleep, she didn’t really pay any attention to it. Anyway, it came from pretty far away.
            Not until she was on her way back to her room did she see where it came from. Under the
            telephone stand there was a large pile of old newspapers and magazines, and this pile
            now began to move. That was where the noise was coming from. All of a sudden the pile
            started to fall over — right, left, forwards, backwards — then there were newspapers and
            magazines all over the floor.</p>
        <p id="content21">Anina could not believe her eyes as she watched a grunting and snorting
            crocodile come out from under the telephone stand.</p>
        <p id="content1">Anina was frozen to the spot. Her eyes wide as saucers, she watched the
            crocodile crawl completely out of the newspapers and slowly look around the apartment.
            It seemed to have just come out of the water because its whole body was dripping wet.
            Wherever the crocodile stepped, the carpet under it became drenched.</p>
		<div>
            <img id="content9" height="364" width="400"
            alt="Picture of a crocodile with mouth open in a wet hallway. Magazines are strewn over the floor."
            src="apip_exemplarSection01resources/apip_exemplarSection01_croc.png"/>
		</div>
        <p id="content5">The crocodile moved its head back and forth letting out a loud hissing
            sound. Anina swallowed hard, looking at the crocodile’s snout with its terribly long row
            of teeth. It swung its tail slowly back and forth. Anina had read about that in “Animal
            Magazine”— how the crocodile whips the water with its tail to chase away or attack its
            enemies.</p>
        <p id="content13">Her gaze fell on the last issue of “Animal Magazine,” which had fallen
            from the pile and was lying at her feet. She got another shock. The cover of the
            magazine used to have a picture of a big crocodile on a river bank. The river bank was
            now empty!</p>
        <p id="content3">Anina bent down and picked up the magazine. At that moment the crocodile
            whipped his tail so hard that he cracked the big vase of sunflowers on the floor and the
            sunflowers scattered everywhere. With a quick jump Anina was in her bedroom. She slammed
            the door shut, grabbed her bed and pushed it up against the door. She had built a
            barricade that would keep her safe from the crocodile. Relieved, she let her breath out.
            But then she hesitated. What if the beast was simply hungry? Maybe to make the crocodile
            go away you had to give it something to eat?</p>
        <p id="content2">Anina looked again at the animal magazine. If the crocodile could crawl out
            of a picture then perhaps other animals could too. Anina hastily flipped through the
            magazine and stopped at a swarm of flamingos in a jungle swamp. Just right, she thought.
            They look like a birthday cake for crocodiles.</p>
        <p id="content10">Suddenly there was a loud crack and the tip of the crocodile’s tail pushed
            through the splintered door. Quickly, Anina held the picture of the flamingos up to the
            hole in the door and called as loud as she could, “Get out of the swamp! Shoo! Shoo!”
            Then she threw the magazine through the hole into the hallway, clapped her hands and
            yelled and screamed.</p>
        <p id="content12">She could hardly believe what happened next. The entire hallway was
            suddenly filled with screeching flamingos wildly flapping their wings and running around
            all over the place on their long, skinny legs. Anina saw one bird with a sunflower in
            its beak and another grabbing her mother’s hat from its hook. She also saw a flamingo
            disappear into the croc0dile’s mouth. With two quick bites he swallowed the flamingo and
            quickly followed it with another, the one with the sunflower in its beak.</p>
		<div>
            <img id="content16" height="252" width="300"
            alt="Four flamingos are walking out of an open magazine photograph."
            src="apip_exemplarSection01resources/apip_exemplarSection01_flamingos.png"/>
		</div>
        <p id="content15">After two portions of flamingo the crocodile seemed to have had enough and
            lay down contentedly in the middle of the hallway. When he had closed his eyes and no
            longer moved, Anina quietly opened her door and slipped through it into the hallway. She
            placed the empty magazine cover in front of the crocodile's nose. “Please,” she
            whispered, “please go back home.” She crept back into the bedroom and looked through the
            hole in the door. She saw the crocodile back on the cover of the magazine.</p>
        <p id="content14">She now went cautiously into the living room where the flamingos were
            crowded around the sofa and standing on the television. Anina opened the magazine to the
            page with the empty picture. “Thank you,” she said, “thank you very much. You may now go
            back to your swamp.”</p>
        <p id="content8">In the morning, it was very difficult for her to explain the giant wet spot
            on the floor and the broken door to her parents. They weren’t convinced about the
            crocodile even though her mother’s hat was nowhere to be found.</p>

                                pushed through the splintered door. Quickly, Anina held the picture
                                of the flamingos up to the hole in the door and called as loud as
                                she could, “Get out of the swamp! Shoo! Shoo!” Then she threw the
                                magazine through the hole into the hallway, clapped her hands and
                                yelled and screamed.</textToSpeechPronunciation>
