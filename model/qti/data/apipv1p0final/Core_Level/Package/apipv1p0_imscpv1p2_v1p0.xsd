            Status:         Final Release
            Description:    This is the APIPv1.0 profile of the IMS CPv1.2 specification. This is a normative 
                            representation of the IMS CP 1.2 Information Model for binding purposes.  Read 
                            the corresponding IMS CP Information Model for the Platform Independent Model 
                            representation.
